# KROME

This folder includes all the essentials to run the KROME routines for this work, for the momment this network is not the final one as we need to refine its content, take some attention to the options file as is a basic options file but is the one needed in our case and also take a look at the krome_all.f90 file, as it's modified to run our krome routines including krate_cr_evaporation function as well as krome_init_coef, necessary to speed up some routines in KROME, also the dust reactions are included in a range of dust temperature parameter as after Tdust > 1.2d3 these reactions stop, which is important to take into account, also look at the krome_user_commons.f90 file as it includes the myCoe parameter initialized with the total number of reactions as an integer (myCoe(<nrea>))
